<p>Hello! My name is Jackson Myatt. I was born in 1996 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Growing up, I spent a lot of time outside: playing sports, hiking, camping, etc. I also developed an interest in Geography from exploring new areas and studying maps of those areas. After graduating High School I attended Arizona State University in pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Geography. Along the way, I discovered GIS, Urban Planning, and Environmental Science and their ties to Geography. I graduated in May of 2018 and moved back home to escape the Desert heat!<br>
Now, I am working on a Master's of Science in GIS Development via an online program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Their program excites me because the modernity of their curriculum, the availability of helpful supplemental resources, and connections to their established faculty. I hope to gain expertise in GIS and other supplemental cutting-edge technologies to push forward geospatial technology so I can join the wave of improving the World.<br>
Outside of my professional life, I spend a lot of time outside. I love to play sports, hike, camp, create videos and travel, hence the photo of me in Copenhagen! I hope you take a moment to explore my web portfolio and contact me if you would like to talk!</p>
